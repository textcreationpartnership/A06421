            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In briefe then, that principall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive that cauſed me to publiſh this Tranſlation, was, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme herein the pious duty of a ſurviving ſonne unto the deare memory of a deceaſed father: who as hee was a true lover of Schollers, and Learning, (eſpecially of this kind) will I doubt not finde favourable entertainment amongſt thoſe that are converſant in theſe ſtudies, and beare affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Greeke tongue. Hee was indeed no profeſt ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler nor tooke any more than one degree in this famous Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſitie, having beene ſometimes of <hi>Oriell</hi> Colledge: but yet although hee were taken off by a countrie retirement, hee never loſt the true taſt and reliſh that diſtinguiſhes men of this education, but rather made continuall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of that nutriment which hee had received in his yonger daies, from the breaſts of this his honoured mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. His ſtudie or rather his recreation, was chiefely in the Greeke tongue, and of his knowledge herein hee hath left unto the world ſufficient teſtimonies, of which theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Dialogues are a part, and theſe with divers other things of his performance, being at this time in my cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
<pb facs="tcp:9374:4"/>
I ſuppoſed I could not do him more right, nor his friends and mine better ſatisfaction (whoſe deſires herein challenge a ſecond motive) than to give them free libertie, and ſuffer him by this meanes to propagate his owne me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, which may chance to laſt longer in this ſmall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of his owne raiſing (or in ſome larger hereafter) than in the hardeſt marble poſteritie can erect him. What I have added here, is not worth ſpeaking of, much leſſe the cenſuring: Onely let mee ſay thus much, to defend my owne innocence from the blacke mouth'd obloquie of ſuch as can ſpeake no other colour, that in the Authors life I have not gone about (farre be your charities from ſuch a thought) to acquit him from any of thoſe villanies and blaſphemous impieties wherewith hee hath beene truly charged; but ſo farre to vindicate theſe innoxious workes of his, as reaſon and your owne ſelves muſt needs (I know) allow of in the reſt, I have onely endeavour'd to make the Tranſlator underſtood, as hee the author, wherein I have not thought it much, though perhaps ſome may, to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to the ſatisfaction even of the meaneſt capacities (for to this end was it tranſlated that all might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it) otherwiſe, the Engliſh, would be to many, almoſt as much Greeke as the Originall: and herein if I have done ought amiſſe, when I know it, I ſhall both acknowledge it and deſire your pardon hoping in the meane ſpace that your ingenuous candor will lay the fault where it is due, that is on mee, not the Tranſlator, nor cauſe the worke to ſuffer, if I have any where failed. This I hope will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſatisfie you to whom I write, unto whom I ſubmit both my ſelfe and this, and ſo reſt, a true lover of yous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and honourer of your vertues.</p>

The other, to gaine ſuch a competent knowledge and underſtanding in other men, as to be able, not onely to make their lives and actions our examples, but to leave them as rules and patterns to them that ſhall come after us. They therefore that profeſſe the latter, had need to bee well verſt, and skilfull in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: for he that is too ſhort in the knowledge of himſelfe, may be ſoone over-ſhot in his opinion of another. And therefore I have alwayes thought it a bold adventure of thoſe that take upon them to become anſwerable to poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb facs="tcp:9374:6"/>
for other mens lives, ſeeing there are few or none that have obſerv'd ſuch an orderly methode of living, as to be able to give any juſt account of their owne: and can there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be hardly thought fit, and competent judges of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans. Written lives, being nothing elſe but the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments of the minde: as the plaine draught, and extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of a picture are of the body: colours may give it or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament and beauty, but addes but little to the true reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance: as he then that undertakes to copie out the one, had need to bee well skil'd in the compoſure and difference of faces; ſo he that adventures to draw the other ought to bee as cleare ſighted in diſcerning manners and actions. For the leaſt miſtake but of the ſmalleſt touch or ſhaddow in a face, alters the ſhape, and poſture of the countenance: and in matter either of life or government, the inſertion or omiſſion of the meaneſt circumſtance may give an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and difference to an action.</p>
            <p>As for our author now in hand, there is but little trust to bee given to the tracke of former times: for ſome that have heretofore undertaken to record his life, having drawne three or foure ſeverall perſons of that name, ſome Sophiſters, ſome Rhetoricians, and living at ſeverall times into one <hi>Lucian,</hi> have not ſo much wrote his life as made it.

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter I had given over going to ſchoole, and was grown to be a ſtripling of ſome good ſtature, my father adviſed with his friends, what it were beſt for him to breed mee to: and the opinion of moſt was, that to make mee a ſcholler, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour would be long, the charge great, &amp; would require a plentifull purſe: whereas our meanes were poore, &amp; would ſoone ſtand in need of ſpeedy ſupply: but if he would ſet mee to learn ſome manuall art or other, I ſhould quickly get by my trade enough to ſerve my owne turne, and never be troubleſome for my diet at home, if I were placed abroad, neither would it be long before I ſhould make my father a glad man, to ſee mee daily bring home with mee what I had got by my labours. This being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded upon we begunne to conſult againe what trade was beſt, ſooneſt learned, and moſt befitting a freeman, that would be ſet up with an eaſie charge, and bring in a profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble returne. With that, ſome began to commend one trade, ſome another, as every mans fancie or experience led him. but my father caſting his eyes upon mine uncle (for my uncle by the mothers ſide was there preſent, an excellent workman in ſtone, and held to be one of the beſt ſtatuaries
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:9374:10"/>
in all the country) by no meanes, (ſaid he) can I endure that any other art ſhould take place, as long as you are in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: take him therefore to you (ſhewing him mee) and teach him to be a skilfull workman in ſtone, how to joynt them together neatly, and to faſhion his ſtatues cunningly: he is able enough for it, and his nature inclinable enough to it: this he conjectured, becauſe he had ſeene ſome toies of mine made out of waxe; for I could no ſooner come home from ſchole, but I ſhould be tempering waxe together, and out of it counterfeit the ſhapes both of oxen, horſes, and men, and (as my father thought) hanſomely enough, which my maſters were wont to whip me for, though now it tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to my commendation: but thoſe kinde of figments put mee in good hopes that I ſhould learne my trade the ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and that very day was thought luckie for mee to be initiated into the art, whereupon I was committed to my uncle, and to confeſſe the truth, not much againſt my will: for I thought it would prove but a kinde of ſport, and that I ſhould be thought a brave fellow among my companions, if I could carve out gods, and pretty puppets, both for my ſelfe, and thoſe lads I beſt liked of. But it fell out with mee, as with other yong beginners: for my uncle putting a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving toole into my hand, bad mee therewith to ſtrike a table that lay before mee, ſoftly and gently, adding withall this old proverbe <note n="a" place="margin">

               </note> What's well begunne is halfe done: but my ignorance was ſuch, that I ſmote too hard, and the table burſt in peeces: which put him ſo farre out of patience, that he gave mee hanſell in a harſh meaſure, as I thought, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the bounds of due correction, inſomuch that teares were the proeme of my occupation, and I ranne away as faſt as I could, crying out with full eyes, telling how I had been laſht, and ſhewing the prints which the ſtroakes had made upon mee, exclaiming upon ſuch crueltie, and adding this of mine owne, that it was onely for envie, left in the end I ſhould prove a better workman then himſelfe: this gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved my mothers heart, and ſhee railed bitterly againſt her brother for uſing me with ſuch extremitie: but when night

But that which moſt of all put me out of heart, was to heare how much they differed in opinions amongſt themſelves, thwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and overthwarting one another in every thing they ſpake: yet every man would have mee to bee a follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his, and ſeeke to draw me to the bent of his owne bowe.</p>

I was vehemently kindled againſt him, but knew not what to doe to him, for I was ſtiffe and cold: but that curſed chamber-maid of mine as ſoone as ſhe heard the noyſe of ſome that were comming in, moiſtned her eyes with ſpittle as if ſhe had wept for me, and howling out, called upon my name, and ſo went out of the roome: but if I could catch them.</p>

               <p>Hearken then to me, moſt reverent goddeſſe: I dwelt upon earth neare unto the Tyrant, and perfectly ſaw all that he did, and could thinke no otherwiſe but that hee was a kinde of God: for when I beheld his glorious purple robe, the multitude of his attendance, his gold, his goblets beſet with precious ſtones, and his Bedſteads of ſilver; I could not but thinke him a happy man: nay, the very ſmoak of the diſhes that were prepared for his dinner made me almoſt madde, ſo that I thought him to be more than a man, and the moſt fortunate of all other; yea, to be indued with greater beauty and comelineſſe than any man elſe, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced by fortune the heigth of a large cubit above all other men: his gate was ſtately, he vaunted himſelfe proudly, and all he met withall he put out of countenance.

Thus were they wholy diſcomfited on all hands, many were taken priſoners, and many ſlaine: much blood was ſpilt, ſome fell upon the clouds, which made them looke of a red colour, as ſometimes they appeare to us about Sunne ſetting: ſome dropt downe upon the earth: which made mee ſuppoſe it was upon ſome ſuch occaſion,<note place="margin">Iliad. lib. 16. v. 459.</note> that <hi>Homer</hi> thought <hi>Jupiter</hi> rained blood for the death of his ſonne <hi>Sarpedon:</hi> returning from the purſuit, vvee erected two Trophies: one for the fight on foote, which wee placed upon the ſpiders webbe: the other for the fight in the aire, which wee ſet up upon the clouds: as ſoone as this was done, newes came to us by our ſcouts, that the <hi>Nephelocentaures</hi> were comming on, which indeed ſhould have come to <hi>Phaethon</hi> before the fight.

Now, vvhat ſtrange novelties wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of note I obſerved during the time of my abode there, I will relate unto you. The firſt is, that they are not begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of vvomen but of mankinde: for they have no other marriage but af males: the name of women is utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne among them: untill they accompliſh the age of five and twentie yeares, they are given in marriage to others: from that time forwards they take others in marriage to themſelves: for as ſoone as the infant is conceived the legge begins to ſwell, and afterwards vvhen the time of birth is come, they give it a lance and take it out dead:<note place="margin">Why that part which we terme the calfe, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> the belly of the legge.</note> then they lay it abroad vvith open mouth towards the vvinde, and ſo it takes life: and I thinke thereof the <hi>Grecians</hi> call it the bellie of the legge, becauſe there in they beare their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren inſtead of a belly. I will tell you now of a thing more ſtrange than this: there are a kinde of men among them called <hi>Dendritans,</hi> which are begotten in this manner: they cut out the right ſtone out of a mans codd, and ſet it in their ground, from which ſpringeth up a great tree of fleſh, with branches and leaves, bearing a kinde of fruit much like to an acorne, but of a cubite in length, which
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:9374:67"/>
they gather when they are ripe, and cut men out of them: their privie members are to be ſet on, and taken off, as they have occaſion: rich men have them made of Ivorie, poore men of vvood, vvherewith they performe the act of generation, and accompanie their ſpowſes: vvhen a man is come to his full age hee dieth not, but is diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved like ſmoake and is turned into aire. One kinde of food is common to them all:<note place="margin">Their food.</note> for they kindle a fire and broyle frogges upon the coales, vvhich are with them in infinite numbers flying in the aire, and whilſt they are broyling, they ſit round about them, as it were about a table, and lappe up the ſmoake that riſeth from them, and feaſt themſelves therewith, and this is all their feeding: for their drinke, they have aire beaten in a morter,<note place="margin">Their drinke.</note> which yeeldeth a kinde of moyſture much like unto dew: they have no avoydance of excrements, either of urine or dung, neither have they any iſſue for that purpoſe, like unto us: their boyes admit copulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not like unto ours, but in their hammes, a little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the calfe of the legge, for there they are open: they hold it a great ornament to be bald, for hairie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are abhord with them,<note place="margin">Becauſe that Comets ſeeme to be hairie, and have their name from thence.</note> and yet among the Starres that are Comets, it is thought commendable, as ſome that have travelled thoſe coaſts reported unto us: ſuch beards as they have, are growing a little above their knees: they have no nailes on their feete, for their whole foote is all but one toe: every one of them at the point of his rumpe, hath a long colewort growing out in ſtead of a tale, alwaies greene and flouriſhing, which though a man fall upon his backe, cannot be broken: the dropping of their noſes is more ſweete than honey: when they labour or exerciſe themſelves, they annoint their bodie with milke, whereinto if a little of that honey chance to drop, it will be turned into cheeſe: they make very fat oile of their beanes, and of as delicate a ſavour as any ſweet oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: they have many vines in thoſe parts, which yeeld them but water: for the grapes that hang upon the cluſters
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:9374:67"/>
are like our haleſtones: and I verily thinke, that when the vines there are ſhaken with a ſtrong winde, there falls a ſtorme of haile amongſt us, by the breaking down of thoſe kinde of berries: their bellies ſtand them inſtead of ſachels, to put in their neceſſaries, which they may open and ſhut at their pleaſure, for they have neither liver, nor any kind of entralls, onely they are rough and hairie within, ſo that when their young children are cold, they may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed therein to keepe them warme: the rich men have garments of glaſſe, very ſoft and delicate, the poorer ſort of braſſe woven, whereof they have great plentie, which they inſeame with water, to make it fit for the workman, as we do our wooll. If I ſhould write what manner of eies they have, I doubt I ſhould be taken for a liar,<note place="margin">

                  <p>The like is faign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Poets of the <hi>Gorgons,</hi> three ſiſters that had but one eye amongſt them which they uſed by turnes when they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</p>
               </note> in publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a matter ſo incredible: yet I cannot chuſe but tell it: for they have eyes to take in and out as pleaſe themſelves: and when a man is ſo diſpoſed, hee may take them out and lay them by till hee have occaſion to uſe them, and then put them in and ſee againe: many when they have loſt their owne eies, borrow of others: for the rich have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lying by them: their eares are all made of the leaves of plane-trees, excepting thoſe that come of acornes, for they onely have them made of vvood. I ſaw alſo another ſtrange thing in the ſame court: a mightie great glaſſe, lying upon the top of a pit, of no great depth, whereinto, if any man deſcend, hee ſhall heare every thing that is ſpoken upon the earth: if hee but looke into the glaſſe, hee ſhall ſee all cities, and all nations as well as if hee were among them: there had I the ſight of all my friends, and the whole countrie about: whether they ſaw mee or not I cannot tell: but if they beleeve it not to be ſo, let them take the paines to goe thither them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and they ſhall finde my words true: then we tooke our leaves of the king, and ſuch as were neare him, and tooke ſhipping, and departed: at which time <hi>Endymion</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon mee two mantles made of their glaſſe, &amp; five of braſſe, with a compleat armour of thoſe ſhells of lupines,

all which I left behinde mee in the whale: and ſent with us a thouſand of his <hi>Hippogypians</hi> to conduct us five hundred furlongs on our way: In our courſe we coaſted many other countries, and laſtly arrived at the morning ſtarre now newly inhabited, where wee landed, and tooke in freſh water: from thence wee entred the <hi>Zodiake,</hi> paſſing by the Sunne, and leaving it on our right hand tooke our courſe neare unto the ſhoare, but landed not in the country, though our companie did much deſire it, for the winde would not give us leave: but wee ſaw it was a flouriſhing region, fat, and well watered, abounding with all delights: but the <hi>Nephelocentaures</hi> eſpying us, who were mercenary ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to <hi>Phaethon,</hi>

The third after, the Ocean appeared plainly unto us, though we could ſee no land, but what was in the aire: and thoſe countries alſo ſeemed to be fierie and of a glittering colour: the fourth day about noone, the winde gently forbearing, ſettled us faire and leaſurely into the ſea: and as ſoone as wee found our ſelves upon water, we were ſurpriſed with incredible gladneſſe, and our joy was unexpreſſible: we feaſted and made mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie with ſuch proviſion as wee had, we caſt our ſelves into the ſea, and ſwamme up and downe for our diſport, for it was a calme. But oftentimes it falleth out, that the change to the better, is the beginning of greater evils: for when wee had made onely two daies ſaile in the water, as ſoone as the third day appeared, about Sun-riſing, upon a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine wee ſaw many monſtrous fiſhes and whales: but one above the reſt containing in greatneſſe fifteene hundred furlongs, which came gaping upon us and troubled the ſea round about him, ſo that hee was compaſſed on every ſide with froth and fome, ſhewing his teeth a farre off,<note place="margin">A fiſh of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different ſize.</note> which were longer than any beech trees are with us, all as ſharpe as needles, and as white as Ivorie; then wee tooke, as wee thought, our laſt leaves one of another, and embracing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, expected our ending day: the monſter was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently with us, and ſwallowed us up ſhippe and all: but by chance, he caught us not betweene his chops, for the ſhip fliot thorow the void paſſages downe into his entralls: when we were thus got within him wee continued a good
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:9374:69"/>
while in darkeneſſe and could ſee nothing, till hee began to gape, and then we perceived it to be a monſtrous whale of a huge breadth and height, bigge enough to containe a citie that would hold tenne thouſand men: and within wee found ſmall fiſhes, and many other creatures chopt in pieces, and the maſts of ſhips, and ankers, and bones of men, and luggage: in the midſt of him was earth and hills, which were raiſed, as I conjectured, by the ſettling of the mudde which came downe his throat: for woods grew upon them and trees of all ſorts, and all manner of hearbes, and it looked as if it had beene husbanded:<note place="margin">A countrie within the whale.</note> the compaſſe of the land was two hundred and fortie furlongs: there were alſo to be ſeene all kind of ſeafowle, as gulls, halcyons, and others that had made their neſts upon the trees: then wee fell to weeping abundantly: but at the laſt I rowſ'd up my companie, and propt up our ſhip: and ſtroke fier: then wee made ready ſupper of ſuch as wee had, for abundance of all ſort of fiſh lay ready by us, and wee had yet water enough left which wee brought out of the Morning Starre: the next morrow wee roſe to watch when the whale ſhould gape: and then looking out, we could ſometimes ſee mountaines, ſometimes onely the skies, and many times Iſlands: for we found that the fiſh carried himſelfe with great ſwiftneſſe to every part of the ſea: when we grew weary of this, I tooke ſeaven of my company, and went into the wood to ſee what I could finde there, and wee had not gone above five furlongs, but we light upon a temple erected to <hi>Neptune,</hi> as by the title appeared: and not farre off wee eſpied many ſepulchers and pillars placed upon them, with a fountaine of cleare water cloſe unto it; we alſo heard the barking of a dogge, and ſaw ſmoake riſe a farre off, ſo that wee judged there was ſome dwelling thereabout: wherefore making the more haſt, wee lighted upon an old man and a youth, who were very buſie in making a garden and in conveying water by a channell from the fountaine into it: whereupon we were ſurpriſed both with joy and feare: and they alſo were brought into the ſame taking, and for a long time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained

it better to keepe them in bonds, untill embaſſadours ſhould come from the <hi>Bucephalians</hi> to ranſome them that vvere taken, and indeed they did: and I vvell underſtood by the nodding of their heads, and their lamentable lowing, like petitioners, what their buſineſſe vvas: ſo vvee agreed upon a ranſome of ſundrie cheeſes, and dried fiſh, and oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and foure deere vvith three legges a peece, two behind and one before: upon theſe conditions vvee delivered thoſe vvhom vvee had taken, and tarrying there but one day, departed: then the fiſhes began to ſhewe themſelves in the ſea, and the birds flew over our heads, and all other tokens of our approach to land appeared unto us: vvithin a vvhile after vvee ſaw men travelling the ſeas, and a nevv found manner of navigation, themſelves ſupplying the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice both for ſhippe and ſailer: and I will tell you hovv: As they lye upon their backes in the water and their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie members ſtanding upright, vvhich are of a large ſiſe and fit for ſuch a purpoſe, they faſten thereto a ſaile, and holding their cords in their hands, vvhen the vvinde hath taken it, are carryed up and downe as pleaſe themſelves: after theſe followed others riding upon corke: for they yoake two dolphines together, and drive them on, (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming themſelves the place of a coach-man) which draw the corke along after them: theſe never offered us any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, nor once ſhunned our ſight, but paſt along in our companie, without feare in a peaceable manner, wondring at the greatneſſe of our ſhippe, and beholding it on every ſide. At evening wee arrived upon a ſmall Iſland, inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as it ſeemed onely by women, which could ſpeake the <hi>Greeke</hi> language: for they came unto us, gave us their hands, and ſaluted us, all attired like vvantons, beautifull, and young, wearing long mantles downe to the foote: the Iſland was called <hi>Cabaluſa,</hi> and the citie <hi>Hydamardia:</hi> ſo the women received us, and every one of them tooke aſide one of us for herſelfe, and made him her gueſt: but I pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a little upon it (for my heart miſgave mee) looked
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:9374:82"/>
narrowly round about, and ſaw the bones of many men, and the ſculls lying together in a corner: yet I thought not good to make any ſtirre, or to call my companie about mee, or to put on armes: but taking the mallow into my hand, made my earneſt prayers thereto, that I might eſcape out of thoſe preſent perils: within a while after, when the ſtrange female came to wait upon mee, I perceived ſhee had not the legges of a woman, but the hoofes of an aſſe: whereupon I drew my ſword, and taking faſt hold of her, bound her, and examined her upon the point: and ſhee though unwillingly, confeſt that they were ſea-women, called <hi>Onoſceleans,</hi> and they fed upon ſtrangers that travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that vvay: for ſaid ſhee, when vvee have made them drunke, wee go to bed to them, and in their ſleepe, make a hand of them: I hearing this, left her bound in the place where ſhee was, and vvent up to the roofe of the houſe, where I made an outcrie, and called my company to mee, and when they were come together, acquainted them with all that I had heard, and ſhewed them the bones, and brought them into her that was bound, who ſuddenly was turned into water, and could not be ſeene: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding I thruſt my ſword into the water, to ſee what would come of it, and it was changed into blood: then wee made all the haſt wee could to our ſhippe, and got us away: and as ſoone as it was cleare day, wee had ſight of the maine land, which wee judged to be the countrie op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to our continent: whereupon wee worſhipped, and made our prayers and tooke counſell what was now to be done: ſome thought it beſt, onely to go a land, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne backe againe: others thought it better to leave our ſhip there, and march into the midland, to trie what the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants would do: but whileſt wee were upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation a violent ſtorme fell upon us, which drave our ſhip againſt the ſhoare, and burſt it all in pieces, and with much adoe wee all ſwam to land with our armes, every man catching what hee could lay hands on: Theſe are all

the occurrences I can acquaint you withall, till the time of our landing both in the ſea, and in our courſe to the Ilands, and in the aire: and after that in the whale: and when wee came out againe, what betide unto us among the <hi>Heroes,</hi> and among the dreames, and laſtly among the <hi>Bucephalians,</hi> and the <hi>Onoſceleans:</hi> what paſt upon land, the next Bookes ſhall deliver.</p>

forth money to loane, and to teach young men for money: again you hate pleaſure, and exclaime againſt Epicures, and yet do, and ſuffer all manner of filthineſſe for pleaſures ſake: if a man invite you not to his feaſt, you will take pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the noſe, if you be invited, you will gorge your ſelves and cramme in till your gutts do cracke, beſide what you give away to your ſervants: and with that word, he ſnatcht at the napkin which <hi>Zenothemis</hi> man had about him, (for it was full of all ſorts of good fleſh) which hee would have looſed, and caſt them all into the floate, but the fellow held hard, and would not let it goe: well done, <hi>Cleodemus,</hi> ſaid <hi>Hermo:</hi> let them tell mee now, why they crie out againſt pleaſure, and yet ſtrive for it more than any other? no, ſaid <hi>Zenothemis,</hi> but do thou tell mee <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus,</hi> in what reſpect thou holdeſt riches to be not indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent: no ſaid hee, but anſwer thou mee, and thus they were at it a great while, till <hi>Io</hi> ſtept forth and ſaid, I pray you be ſilent, &amp; I will propoſe a fit argument to be handled at this preſent, onely, you ſhall ſpeake your mindes every man without contending, and liſten, as if you were buſie at diſputation in the preſence of our <hi>Plato.</hi> All that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent praiſed him for this: eſpecially <hi>Ariſtoenetus</hi> and <hi>Eucri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> hoping now to be freed from their vexation, inſomuch that <hi>Ariſtoenetus</hi> ſhifted into his owne place againe, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting nothing but peace: then came in that ſervice, which is called, the <note n="q" place="margin">With us the ſecond courſe.</note> accompliſhing of the feaſt, which was to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man a fowle, a peece of the boares fleſh, a ſhare, a fiſh fried, and ſugar cakes: eate what they would, and the reſt they might carrie away: yet every man had not a private platter to himſelfe, for <hi>Ariſtoenetus</hi> and <hi>Eucritus</hi> had but one diſh in common betwixt them, and either of them was to take that for his part which was next to him: in like manner another diſh was in common betweene <hi>Zenothemis</hi> the <hi>Stoike</hi> and <hi>Hermo</hi> the <hi>Epicure:</hi> the next in order were <hi>Cleodemus,</hi> and <hi>Io,</hi> after them the bridegrome, and my ſelfe, and then <hi>Diphilus,</hi> who had two parts ſet before him, for <hi>Zeno</hi> his ſcholler, that ſhould have beene his partner, was
